# Python

To warm up for python coding do the following excercises. Use the [00-practice.py](./00-practice.py) to code.

1. Start with a code to reverse an array. Use a loop to do it. Then read up on other techniques mentioned [here](./01-reverse-array.py).

1. Reverse an array. Use loop instead of sortcuts methods.

1. Implement one of the above using a function.

1. Write a program to detect whether a string is palindrome or not. Then read ./03-palindrome.py

1. Iterate an array and print the index and value. See beginner/05-list-loop.py

1. Reverse sentences. See beginner/07-reverse-word-order.py
